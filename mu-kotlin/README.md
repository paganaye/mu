## MU

Have you heard of Mu? It's a cool experimental toy language that can be used for both server-side and client-side web development. Although it has a syntax similar to JavaScript and React, it's not just a clone of those popular languages. In fact, Mu combines the best of both functional and imperative programming paradigms, making it potentially powerful and flexible.

One of Mu's strengths is that it compiles and generates HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that can be executed on the server or sent to the browser. The aim is to make it easy to create dynamic and interactive web applications using a single language. 

One of the key features of Mu is its strong purely functional constructs. Expressions in Mu are reactive, allowing for instant updates of HTML pages without the need for additional constructs.

Another crucial aspect of Mu is its asynchronous mechanism. All functions and methods in Mu are asynchronous, which ensures that the language will never block the web page or the server. 

At present, Mu is implemented in Kotlin, but the goal is for it to be self-compiling in the future. Although still in development, Mu has the potential to be a powerful and flexible language for building robust and high-performance web applications.
