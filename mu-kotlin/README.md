## MU

Mu is an experimental toy language designed for both server-side and client-side web development. Although its syntax is similar to that of JavaScript and React, it is not merely a clone of these popular languages. Instead, Mu combines the best of both functional and imperative programming paradigms, making it a potentially powerful and flexible language.

Mu compiles on the server and generates HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that can be sent to the browser. This makes it easy to create dynamic and interactive web applications using a single language. By generating all the necessary code, Mu enables developers to focus on writing high-quality server-side code without worrying about the details of client-side code.

One of the key features of Mu is its strong purely functional constructs. Functions are treated as first-class citizens and are immutable, and expressions in Mu are reactive, allowing for instant updates of HTML pages without the need for additional constructs.

Another important aspect of Mu is its asynchronous mechanism. All functions and methods in Mu are asynchronous, ensuring that the language will never block the web page or the server. This can greatly improve the performance of both web servers and web applications.

Currently, the language is implemented in Kotlin, but the ultimate goal is for it to be self-compiling in the future.

Although Mu is still in development, it has the potential to be a powerful and flexible language for building robust and high-performance web applications.
